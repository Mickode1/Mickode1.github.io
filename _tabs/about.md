# About Me

Hello! I'm a graduate of Medical Physiology with a keen interest in Computational Biology. My passion lies in understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms that drive diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease, through the lens of transcriptomics and RNA sequencing.

## My Interests

**Computational Biology**: Leveraging computational tools and methods to analyze and interpret complex biological data.

**RNA Sequencing**: Utilizing RNA-seq to explore gene expression patterns and uncover novel transcripts.

**Molecular Mechanisms of Alzheimer's Disease**: Investigating the underlying molecular pathways and genetic factors contributing to Alzheimer's.

**Transcriptomics**: Studying the complete set of RNA transcripts to understand gene regulation and expression in various diseases.

## Skills

**Programming in R**: I use R for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.

**Scientific  writing** 


## Goals

My goal is to contribute to the field of medical research by uncovering new biomarkers and therapeutic targets through transcriptomics. I am dedicated to advancing our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and improving patient outcomes through innovative research.
